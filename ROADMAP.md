# TypingMind Cloud Sync - Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, fixes, and improvements for the cloud sync script.

---

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Critical Issues

- [ ] **Fix Inefficient Backup Compression:** Reverse the order to compress data _before_ encryption. Encrypting first makes compression ineffective.
- [ ] **Improve Change Detection:** Replace item size comparison with content hashing (e.g., SHA-1) to make sync more reliable and prevent unnecessary uploads.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Refactoring & Simplification

- [ ] **Simplify Deletion Monitoring:** Remove the `setInterval`-based polling for deletions and integrate detection into the main `performFullSync` cycle to reduce complexity and background resource usage.
- [ ] **Decouple Components:** Refactor the codebase to use dependency injection instead of relying on the global `window.cloudSyncApp` object. This will improve modularity and testability.
- [ ] **Strengthen Key Derivation:** Use a standard, hardened key derivation function like PBKDF2 with a salt to generate the encryption key from the user's password, improving security.

### üöÄ New Features & Enhancements

- [ ] **Configuration Import/Export:** Add buttons to the settings modal to allow users to export their configuration to a file (excluding secrets) and import it on another device.
- [ ] **Cloud Storage Usage Statistics:** Add a feature to calculate and display the total storage space consumed by sync data and backups in the S3 bucket.
- [ ] **Pre-flight Credential Check:** Add a function to the "Save" button to perform a simple check (e.g., list the bucket) to verify credentials and permissions before saving them. _(Implemented)_
